# old-essays
a curated exhibit of my progress in essay-writing

It's basically just a site containing some really old essays of mine. They're pretty bad, but their verbosity gives them a sort of comedy, at least in my eyes. I converted the essays from .docx to .markdown using pandoc and then added the appropriate headers to add it as a post to the site. I also overrode some of the minima .scss files and html layouts to stylize the website and display the essays by the year they were written in. :koala:
